Hangman Game

## About

This project is a game, a web application in which you have to guess a word. You have several chances and their decreasing number indicates a character that appears as a hangman. You can use the mouse as well as the keyboard. The correct letter is highlighted in green and the incorrect letter in red. After guessing the word or running out of chances, the result screen will be displayed. I used Vue to write this app.
